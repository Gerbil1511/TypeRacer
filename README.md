## Fonts

 [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) using a direct import code within the style.css file.

[Fredoka](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fredoka) serves as playful font to be used within logos, headings other page elements of significance.

[Prompt](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Prompt) is to be used as the primary content font ensuring ease of readability and complementing the Fredoka font choice.

## Features

### General Features

In order to fulfil the criteria the page consists of various sectioned information each with a variety of links, resources and other elements that contribute to a positive user experience. 

Upon coding the project, receiving feedback and implementing the [Bootstrap Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) the features and design shifted slightly from the original wireframe.

Some key adjustments: 

- 

- 


#### Navigation (and Hero Section)

I chose to use a bold and welcoming hero section for the start of the page using the [Bootstrap Jumbotron](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/jumbotron/)

The navigation bar is a Bootstrap component that allows for easy navigation around the site using a familiar method for a positive user experience.

![Navigation & Hero](/documentation/images/nav-and-hero.webp)

#### Bootstrap Cards

I opted to utilise the [Bootstrap Card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/) feature for the main content of the page as this allowed for a clean organisation of the information. 

Within these sections I have also opted to provide additional resources, links and access to contact modals via buttons for ease.

For balance I also gave the cards a consistent height by adding the `h-100` class.

#### ????? Section/s

Mirroring the design of the hero section, 

#### Footer

For the footer again I implemented a [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/footers/) component.



The information provided in this section is considered somewhat standard and provides for a user experience that is easy to understand. 

#### Links and Buttons

### Responsive Design

Utilising the [Bootstrap Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) allowed for an implementation that is responsive without the need for additional CSS or media queries.

Though it took some experimentation and troubleshooting, I have been able to create a page that is fully responsive to modern standards.

This has proven to be a very valuable learning experience in the use of frameworks.
As a result of my debugging within Dev Tools in order to identify and resolve responsiveness issues I believe I have a much greater understanding of how to adpat Bootstrap for use within future projects. 

During testing it was apparent that `

## Deployment


This [GitHub](https://github.com/) project was created using the [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template) ensuring all necessary dependencies were included when opening within the designated workspace on the [Gitopod IDE](https://www.gitpod.io/).

Setup a repo using this method and template:
1. Login to your GitHub profile.
2. Navigate to the Code Institute Full Template
3. Click the dropdown for 'Use this template' and select "Create a new repository"
4. Generate the necessary name and description for your repo and click 'Create repository from template'
5. Navigate to the new repo and click the green 'Open' button with the Gitpod logo<br>
**IMPORTANT - This button should only be clicked once to generate the new IDE workspace**
6. You can now work on your repository within the Code Institute Gitpod IDE workspace

Once the project repo is created, an early deployment for the live project should performed.<br>
This allows for early and continuous testing using a variety of devices, as well as the Dev Tools available within browsers.

Additional information on the deployment process can be found on the official [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)

## Testing

Testing and validation os the website was carried out throughout the course of the project.

This included regular debugging and testing using the Dev Tools as ptovided within Chrome Browser.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py` if your Python file is named `app.py`, of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

By Default, Gitpod gives you superuser security privileges. Therefore, you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.
